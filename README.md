# Business Intelligence Analyst Portfolio

This repository serves as a professional portfolio showcasing my work in **Business Intelligence and Data Analytics**, with a focus on structured analysis, insight generation, and decision support.

I come from a background in **research, due diligence investigations, and risk-focused analysis**, where I have worked extensively with complex qualitative and quantitative information. Through investigative research, OSINT, and structured reporting, I developed a strong ability to synthesize complex findings into clear, decision-ready insights for diverse stakeholders.

By expanding my skill set into **data analytics and business intelligence**—including SQL, Python, and Power BI—I integrate investigative rigor with scalable, data-driven analysis and visual storytelling. This portfolio reflects how I apply analytical methods to support business, operational, and risk-aware decision-making.

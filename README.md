# Business Intelligence Analyst Portfolio

This repository is a personal portfolio showcasing my hands-on projects in **Business Intelligence and Data Analytics**.  
It demonstrates how raw data is transformed into **clean datasets, analytical insights, business recommendations, and decision-support outputs**, with a strong emphasis on structured thinking and real-world relevance.

I come from a professional background in **research, due diligence investigations, and risk-focused analysis**, where I have worked extensively with complex qualitative and quantitative data. Through investigative research, OSINT, and structured reporting, I developed the ability to translate complex findings into clear, decision-ready insights for diverse stakeholders. By combining this investigative rigor with data analytics and BI tools such as **SQL, Python, and Power BI**, I now focus on delivering scalable, data-driven insights through analytical workflows and visual storytelling.

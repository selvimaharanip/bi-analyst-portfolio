# Selvi Maharani Pujianti — Business Intelligence Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I’m **Selvi** 👋  
I am an aspiring **Business Intelligence Analyst** with a background in **research, due diligence investigations, and risk-focused analysis**. My experience trained me to work with complex qualitative and quantitative data, validate information rigorously, and translate findings into clear, decision-ready insights.

By expanding my skill set into **data analytics and business intelligence**—including **SQL, Python, and Power BI**—I combine investigative rigor with structured data analysis and visual storytelling to support **business, operational, and risk-aware decision-making**.

## Analytical Scope

### Python-Based Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Preparing analysis-ready datasets by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistics:** Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies to support data-driven reasoning.
- **A/B Testing & Experimentation:** Designing hypotheses, evaluating metrics, and interpreting results to assess business impact.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applying K-Means clustering and profiling segments to translate analytical results into actionable strategies.

Python queries, analytical logic, and thought processes for these analyses are documented in **Jupyter Notebooks**, executed via **Google Colab**.  
Associated CSV outputs are stored as analytical datasets for transparency and reuse.

## 🧪 Bootcamp Projects Overview

This repository contains analytical projects developed during a **Data Analytics & Business Intelligence Bootcamp**, designed to demonstrate **end-to-end BI workflows**—from data preparation and analysis to insight generation and decision support.

The projects are structured to reflect real-world analytical practices, emphasizing **analytical rigor, clarity of insights, and business relevance**.

## Analytical Scope

### Python-Based Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Preparing analysis-ready datasets by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistics:** Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies to support data-driven reasoning.
- **A/B Testing & Experimentation:** Designing hypotheses, evaluating metrics, and interpreting results to assess business impact.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applying K-Means clustering and profiling segments to translate analytical results into actionable strategies.

Python queries, analytical logic, and thought processes are documented in **Jupyter Notebooks**, executed via **Google Colab**.  
Associated CSV outputs are stored as analytical datasets for transparency and reuse.

## SQL, Business Analysis & Dashboarding

- **SQL Analysis:** Business-oriented queries executed on a relational database provided in the learning environment.
- **Business Analysis:** Structured documentation connecting analytical outputs to process improvement and strategic decision-making.
- **Power BI Dashboards:** Interactive visualizations built from Excel datasets derived from SQL outputs to support monitoring and executive insights.

## Data Notes

- **Operational Dataset (Shared):**  
  Power BI Dashboarding and the operational Business Analysis are based on `delivery_performance_operational_dataset.xlsx`, which is derived from the same source database as the SQL Analysis to ensure a consistent end-to-end operational workflow.

- **Strategic Dataset:**  
  The Business Case & Decision-Making Strategy analysis uses a separate dataset, `delivery_performance_strategic_dataset.xlsx`, built from a different database and structured specifically for strategic and executive-level analysis.

- **A/B Testing:**  
  Conducted using a separate experimental dataset.

- **SQL Lineage:**  
  SQL analysis is performed directly on the operational source database; query logic and derived outputs are included in this repository.

- **Business Analysis & Dashboarding:**  
  Business Analysis consists of two distinct analyses using two different datasets:  
  (1) an operational analysis aligned with SQL and Power BI, and  
  (2) a strategic analysis using a separate dataset for decision modeling.

- **Raw Data Availability:**  
  Due to dataset size limitations, only cleaned sample datasets are included in this repository. The full raw datasets and complete cleaning processes were executed in the original analysis environment.

## Key Takeaway

This repository demonstrates the ability to apply analytics as a **problem-solving and decision-support tool**, bridging technical analysis with business insight and actionable outcomes.

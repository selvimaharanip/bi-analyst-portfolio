# Business Analysis

## Overview

This folder contains two complementary business analyses that address operational and strategic decision-making needs using the same underlying operational data source.

Both analyses are **derived from the same operational data source**, structured differently for each analytical objective. The data was extracted using SQL queries, exported to Excel, and further modeled for analysis and visualization.

# Business Analysis

## Overview

This folder contains two complementary business analyses that address operational and strategic decision-making needs across different logistics and delivery use cases.

Each analysis is built on its own operational dataset, extracted using SQL queries, exported to Excel, and further modeled for analysis and visualization.

The first analysis focuses on **delivery risk and late delivery performance from a customer experience perspective**, while the second focuses on **shipper imbalance and logistics performance from a cost and routing efficiency perspective**.

## Analysis Scope

### 1. Business Process & Problem-Solving  
**File:** `business_process_and_problem_solving.md`

Focuses on identifying *why* delivery performance issues occur by analyzing shipper imbalance, logistics workflows, and operational bottlenecks. This analysis emphasizes root cause identification and process-level improvement using structured frameworks such as root cause analysis and KPI diagnostics.

### 2. Business Case & Decision-Making Strategy  
**File:** `business_case_and_decision_strategy.md`

Focuses on translating operational insights into strategic business decisions. This analysis evaluates:

- Actual late delivery risk and customer experience impact.  
- Structural shipper allocation imbalance and routing inefficiencies.  
- Scenario-based improvement strategies across short, mid, and long-term horizons.

The objective is to support executive-level decision-making using KPI-driven, risk-aware, and data-backed strategies.

## Key Takeaway

Together, these analyses demonstrate an end-to-end analytical workflow—from operational diagnostics to strategic decision-making—showing how the same data foundation can be leveraged to evaluate delivery risk, optimize logistics performance, and support executive-level, data-driven business strategy.

# Business Case & Decision-Making Strategy  
**Shipper Imbalance & Delivery Performance Analysis**

## Overview

**Objective**  
Support executive decision-making by evaluating shipper allocation imbalance, delivery performance risks, and improvement scenarios, and by defining a data-driven strategy to optimize logistics cost, service level, and operational efficiency.

**Context**  
Using operational shipment data across multiple product categories and destination countries, this analysis focuses on identifying structural inefficiencies in shipper routing. Power BI dashboards built from Excel-based datasets are used to assess performance gaps, risk concentration, and business impact.

## Tools & Approach

- **Tools:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Methods & Frameworks:**  
  - KPI Definition & Monitoring  
  - Comparative Performance Analysis  
  - Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)  
  - IMPACT Framework (Identify–Measure–Prioritize–Analyze–Create–Track)

---

## Key Insights

- Shipper usage is highly imbalanced, with **United Package handling 41.65% of total orders** despite having the **highest freight cost, longest ship time, and highest late rate**.
- Late shipments are geographically concentrated in specific countries (e.g. Ireland, Italy, France), indicating **routing risks not being country-aware**.
- Performance issues are systemic, driven by **default routing rules without SLA, cost, or performance-based logic**.

---

## Decision Strategy

Recommended actions are structured into phases:

- **Short-term:**  
  Shipper load balancing (max share threshold), performance monitoring via dashboard.

- **Mid-term:**  
  SLA & cost-based routing, shipper performance scoring system.

- **Long-term:**  
  Vendor renegotiation, country-based routing logic, predictive performance modeling.

---

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

- Shipper Share (%)  
- Late Shipment Rate (%)  
- Average Ship Time (days)  
- Average Freight Cost per Order  

KPIs are monitored periodically to ensure balanced allocation, improved SLA compliance, and sustainable logistics performance.

## Key Takeaway

This case demonstrates how operational logistics data can be transformed into a structured business case, enabling performance-driven routing decisions, cost optimization, and risk-aware supply chain strategy.

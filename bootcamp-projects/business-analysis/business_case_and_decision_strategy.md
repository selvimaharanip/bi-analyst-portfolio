# Business Case & Decision-Making Strategy  
**Delivery Risk & Late Delivery Performance Analysis**

## Overview

**Objective**  
Support executive decision-making by evaluating real delivery performance, identifying structural late delivery risks, and defining improvement scenarios to enhance customer experience and long-term operational performance.

**Context**  
Using operational delivery data (5,000 orders, Aug 2024 – Aug 2025), this analysis shifts focus from SLA compliance to actual customer experience. Power BI dashboards built from Excel-based analytical datasets are used to assess delivery risk, segment performance, and define actionable strategies.

## Tools & Approach

- **Tools:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Methods & Frameworks:**  
  - Exploratory & Diagnostic Analysis  
  - KPI Definition & Monitoring  
  - Scenario Modeling & Risk Assessment  
  - Multi-Framework Analysis (SWOT, PESTEL)  
  - Decision & Implementation Planning  

---

## Key Insights

- Actual late delivery rate (63.66%) significantly exceeds SLA-based late rate (32%), indicating a major gap between operational targets and real customer experience.  
- Delivery delays are highly concentrated in high-risk segments such as peak hours (breakfast & dinner), high/severe traffic conditions, and restaurants with long preparation times.  
- Customer impact is non-linear: delays above 20 minutes cause a sharp drop in ratings, making extreme delays the main driver of dissatisfaction.  
- External factors amplify risk, but internal controls (ETA accuracy, dispatch logic, prep time management) are the primary leverage points for improvement.

## Decision Strategy

Recommended actions are structured into phases:

- **Short-term:** ETA recalibration and courier pre-positioning for high-risk segments  
- **Mid-term:** Dynamic dispatch, routing optimization, and prep-time monitoring  
- **Long-term:** Predictive demand planning and continuous ETA learning loops

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

- Late Delivery % (Actual)  
- Average Delivery Delay  
- Customer Rating  
- SLA Breach Rate  

KPIs are monitored weekly to ensure continuous feedback and adaptive decision-making.

## Key Takeaway

This analysis demonstrates how operational delivery data can be translated into a structured business case. Rather than optimizing SLA metrics in isolation, the focus shifts to actual customer experience and systemic delivery risk, enabling data-driven, risk-aware, and measurable performance improvement.

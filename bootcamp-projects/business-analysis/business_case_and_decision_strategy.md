# Business Case & Decision-Making Strategy

## Overview

**Objective**  
Support executive decision-making by evaluating operational performance, late delivery risks, and improvement scenarios, and by defining a phased implementation strategy to improve customer experience and long-term performance.

**Context**  
Using the same operational data source, this analysis shifts focus from process diagnosis to strategic decision-making. Power BI dashboards built from Excel-based analytical datasets are used to assess risk, evaluate scenarios, and define measurable success criteria.

## Tools & Approach

- **Tools:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Methods & Frameworks:**  
  - KPI Definition & Monitoring  
  - Scenario Modeling & Risk Assessment  
  - Multi-Framework Analysis (SWOT, PESTEL)  
  - Decision & Implementation Planning

---

## Key Insights

- Actual late delivery rates significantly exceed SLA-based thresholds, creating a gap between operational targets and customer experience.
- Delivery delays are highly concentrated in high-risk segments such as peak hours, high traffic conditions, and restaurants with long preparation times.
- External factors amplify delays, but internal controls (ETA accuracy, dispatch, prep time management) are the primary leverage points for improvement.

## Decision Strategy

Recommended actions are structured into phases:
- **Short-term:** ETA recalibration and courier pre-positioning for high-risk segments  
- **Mid-term:** Dynamic dispatch, routing optimization, and prep-time control  
- **Long-term:** Predictive demand planning and continuous ETA learning loops

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

- Late Delivery % (Actual)  
- Average Delivery Delay  
- Customer Rating  
- SLA Breach Rate  

KPIs are monitored weekly to ensure continuous feedback and adjustment.

## Key Takeaway

This analysis demonstrates how operational data can be translated into a structured business case, enabling data-driven decisions, risk-aware planning, and measurable performance improvement.
